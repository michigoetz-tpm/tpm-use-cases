# Technical Program Manager Prompts for Generative AI

**Practical AI prompts, workflows, and tools that help Technical Program Manager for program execution with AI**

When your inbox is overflowing with cross-functional dependencies, you're trying to build alignment across engineering teams, your status reports need structure, or your program timeline is one missed deadline away from chaos, these prompts can be your force multiplier. They're designed to work across Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, or whatever AI tool you have access to.

Think of this as your AI-assisted toolkit for getting real TPM work done faster and better. 


Most people use AI as either a search engine or a form-filler. Neither approach handles the complexity of technical program management well.
These prompts create structured dialogues where you remain the decision-maker while AI helps you think systematically. Context builds incrementally rather than requiring massive upfront input. The prompts embed proven frameworks like RACI, critical path analysis, and risk quantification. They also know when to probe for missing information before generating output.
The progression: Start by using these prompts daily, then customize them for your organization's terminology and processes, eventually build your own, and share what works with your TPM community.
This isn't about outsourcing your judgment—it's about having a thought partner that helps you structure complex, cross-functional problems more rigorously.

## TPM Community - Share & Learn Together!

Teaching others is how we all get better at this.

I believe the best way to improve at technical program management in the AI era is by sharing what works (and what doesn't) and learning from each other. Drop me a note with your use cases.
